## Machine Learning Models and Implementations:

This project leverages various machine learning models to predict gold prices based on historical data. Each model serves a specific purpose in capturing different aspects of the underlying patterns in the dataset.

### 1. Linear Regression Model

- **Purpose:** Linear Regression is used for establishing a linear relationship between the features (e.g., Open, High, Low) and the target variable (Close) to predict gold prices.
  
- **Implementation:** The Linear Regression model is trained on historical data to learn the coefficients that best fit the linear equation. The trained model is saved as `linear_regression_model.pkl`.

### 2. Decision Tree Model

- **Purpose:** Decision Trees are employed to capture non-linear relationships and complex decision boundaries in the dataset.

- **Implementation:** The Decision Tree model is trained on features such as Open, High, Low, and historical gold prices. The trained model is saved as `decision_tree_model.pkl`.
